<h1>  Why slothes should be extinct by are not </h1>

<p>
<div class="why">
    Classified as critically endangered and believed to have a rapidly declining population and habitat area, pygmy three-toed sloths (Bradypus pygmaeus) are native exclusively 
    to the island of Escudo de Veragua, off the Caribbean coast of Panama.The species is notably smaller than other species of sloths. An adult pygmy three-toed sloth weighs between 5.5 and 7.7 pounds and 
    measures 19 to 21 inches in length. Their external ear canals are conspicuously large. These features are thought to be indicative of a relatively rapid evolution of a new species in an isolated, 
    island habitat. Very little is known about their lifespan. Pygmy three-toed sloths have been primarily recorded in the red mangrove forests surrounding the island. They mainly feed on mangrove leaves, 
    which puts the population at risk when the mangrove forests are logged.
